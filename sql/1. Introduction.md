# Introduction
- Database is a ==collection of data== in a format that can be easily accessed 
- A software application used to manage our DB is called DBMS
## WHAT IS SQL
- SQL is a programming language used to interact with relational databases
- It used to perform CRUD 
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

### Deep Dive into Database Structure

A database is a systematic collection of data. Databases support storage and manipulation of data and ensure data management is easy. Let's delve deeper into the key components and concepts of database structure:

#### 1. Database
- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
- Databases are managed using a Database Management System (DBMS).

#### 2. DBMS (Database Management System)
- Software that uses a standard method to manage databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.
- Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.

#### 3. Schemas
- A schema is a logical container for database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures.
- It helps in organizing data and can represent the entire database structure.

#### 4. Tables
- The fundamental structure for storing data in a relational database.
- Composed of rows and columns:
  - **Columns**: Define the data type and structure. Each column has a name and a data type (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR).
  - **Rows**: Contain individual records with values corresponding to each column.

##### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    Position VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

#### 5. Primary Keys and Foreign Keys
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a row in a table. Ensures each row is uniquely identifiable.
  ```sql
  PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)
  ```
- **Foreign Key**: A field in a table that uniquely identifies a row in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
  ```sql
  FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
  ```

#### 6. Indexes
- Structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.
- Can be created on one or more columns of a table.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
  ```

#### 7. Views
- Virtual tables created by querying one or more tables.
- They do not store data physically but provide a way to look at data from multiple tables.
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Position, Salary
  FROM Employees;
  ```

#### 8. Stored Procedures
- Precompiled collections of SQL statements and optional control-of-flow statements.
- They help in reusing code and improving performance.
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails (@EmployeeID INT)
  AS
  BEGIN
      SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
  END;
  ```

#### 9. Triggers
- Special procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a particular table or view.
- Commonly used for maintaining integrity, enforcing business rules, and auditing changes.
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_insert
  AFTER INSERT ON Employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
      -- trigger logic
  END;
  ```

#### 10. Constraints
- Rules enforced on data columns to ensure data integrity.
  - **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
  - **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
  - **CHECK**: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
  - **DEFAULT**: Provides a default value for a column if none is specified.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
  );
  ```

### Relational Database Concepts

#### 1. Normalization
- The process of organizing data to minimize redundancy.
- Involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

#### 2. Relationships
- Define how tables interact with each other.
  - **One-to-One**: A single row in one table is linked to a single row in another table.
  - **One-to-Many**: A single row in one table is linked to multiple rows in another table.
  - **Many-to-Many**: Multiple rows in one table are linked to multiple rows in another table, typically managed through a junction table.

##### Example Relationship:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments (DepartmentID)
);
```

#### 3. Transactions
- A sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single unit.
- **ACID Properties**:
  - **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
  - **Isolation**: Ensures that intermediate transaction results are invisible to other transactions.
  - **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

### Summary
- **Database**: Organized collection of data.
- **DBMS**: Software for managing databases.
- **Tables**: Store data in rows and columns.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Maintain unique identification and relationships.
- **Indexes, Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Constraints**: Enhance performance, organization, and integrity.
- **Normalization and Relationships**: Organize data and define interactions.
- **Transactions**: Ensure reliable and consistent data management.
