### SQL Subqueries

A **subquery**, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query embedded within another SQL query. Subqueries are used to perform operations that require multiple steps and can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, and `HAVING` clauses. They can be used to retrieve data that will be used by the outer query.

#### Types of Subqueries

1. **Single-Row Subqueries**
2. **Multiple-Row Subqueries**
3. **Multiple-Column Subqueries**
4. **Correlated Subqueries**

#### 1. Single-Row Subqueries

A single-row subquery returns a single row and a single column. It is often used with comparison operators such as `=`, `<`, `>`, etc.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1
  FROM table1
  WHERE column2 = (SELECT column2
                   FROM table2
                   WHERE condition);
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT EmployeeName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID
                        FROM Departments
                        WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales');
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query retrieves the names of employees who work in the 'Sales' department. The subquery finds the `DepartmentID` for the 'Sales' department, which is then used in the outer query to find employees in that department.

#### 2. Multiple-Row Subqueries

A multiple-row subquery returns more than one row. It is often used with operators such as `IN`, `ANY`, or `ALL`.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1
  FROM table1
  WHERE column2 IN (SELECT column2
                     FROM table2
                     WHERE condition);
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT EmployeeName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID
                          FROM Departments
                          WHERE Location = 'New York');
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query retrieves the names of employees who work in departments located in 'New York'. The subquery retrieves the `DepartmentID` values for departments in 'New York', and the outer query selects employees in those departments.

#### 3. Multiple-Column Subqueries

A multiple-column subquery returns more than one column. It is used with the `IN` operator and requires the outer query to compare against multiple columns.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table1
  WHERE (column1, column2) IN (SELECT column1, column2
                                FROM table2
                                WHERE condition);
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT EmployeeID, DepartmentID
  FROM Employees
  WHERE (EmployeeID, DepartmentID) IN (SELECT EmployeeID, DepartmentID
                                        FROM ContractorAssignments
                                        WHERE AssignmentDate = '2024-01-01');
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query retrieves `EmployeeID` and `DepartmentID` for employees who also have an assignment in the `ContractorAssignments` table for a specific date.

#### 4. Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. It is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1
  FROM table1 outer_table
  WHERE column2 = (SELECT column2
                   FROM table2 inner_table
                   WHERE outer_table.column3 = inner_table.column3);
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT EmployeeName
  FROM Employees e
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
                FROM Departments d
                WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
                  AND d.Budget > 1000000);
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query retrieves the names of employees who work in departments with a budget greater than 1,000,000. The subquery checks each department's budget and is correlated with the outer query via `DepartmentID`.

### Summary

- **Single-Row Subqueries**: Return a single row and are used with comparison operators.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM table WHERE column = (SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition);`

- **Multiple-Row Subqueries**: Return multiple rows and are used with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, or `ALL`.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM table WHERE column IN (SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition);`

- **Multiple-Column Subqueries**: Return multiple columns and are used with `IN`.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM table WHERE (column1, column2) IN (SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition);`

- **Correlated Subqueries**: Reference columns from the outer query and are executed for each row processed by the outer query.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ... FROM table2 WHERE table1.column = table2.column);`

Subqueries provide a powerful way to perform complex queries and data retrieval operations in SQL, allowing for more sophisticated data manipulation and analysis.
