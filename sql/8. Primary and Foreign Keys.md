# Primary and Foreign Keys in SQL

## Primary Key

A **primary key** is a column, or a set of columns, that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The primary key ensures that each record in the table is unique and not null.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Uniqueness**: Each value in the primary key column must be unique.
  - **Non-null**: The primary key column cannot contain null values.
  - **Single Column or Composite**: A primary key can consist of a single column or multiple columns (composite key).

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 data_type PRIMARY KEY,
      column2 data_type,
      ...
  );
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      DepartmentID INT
  );
  ```

- **Composite Primary Key Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE CourseEnrollments (
      StudentID INT,
      CourseID INT,
      EnrollmentDate DATE,
      PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)
  );
  ```

## Foreign Key

A **foreign key** is a column, or a set of columns, in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. The foreign key establishes a relationship between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Referential Integrity**: The foreign key ensures that the value in the foreign key column must match a value in the primary key column of the referenced table.
  - **Optional Null Values**: Foreign key columns can contain null values if not explicitly defined as NOT NULL.
  - **Cascading Actions**: Actions such as `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` can be defined to maintain referential integrity automatically.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 data_type,
      column2 data_type,
      ...
      FOREIGN KEY (column) REFERENCES parent_table (primary_key_column)
  );
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
      OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      OrderDate DATE,
      CustomerID INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
  );
  ```

- **Cascading Actions Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
      OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      OrderDate DATE,
      CustomerID INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
      ON DELETE CASCADE
      ON UPDATE CASCADE
  );
  ```

## Establishing Relationships

Primary and foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database. Hereâ€™s how they work together:

### 1. **One-to-One Relationship**
Each row in Table A is linked to one and only one row in Table B, and vice versa.

- **Example**: A `UserProfile` table may have a one-to-one relationship with a `User` table where `UserID` is the primary key in both tables.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Users (
      UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      UserName VARCHAR(50)
  );

  CREATE TABLE UserProfiles (
      UserProfileID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      UserID INT,
      Bio TEXT,
      FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
  );
  ```

### 2. **One-to-Many Relationship**
Each row in Table A can be linked to multiple rows in Table B.

- **Example**: A `Department` table may have a one-to-many relationship with an `Employees` table where `DepartmentID` is the primary key in `Department` and a foreign key in `Employees`.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Departments (
      DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
  );

  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      DepartmentID INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
  );
  ```

### 3. **Many-to-Many Relationship**
Each row in Table A can be linked to multiple rows in Table B, and each row in Table B can be linked to multiple rows in Table A. This relationship is usually implemented using a junction table.

- **Example**: A `Students` table and a `Courses` table may have a many-to-many relationship implemented through a `CourseEnrollments` junction table.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Students (
      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      StudentName VARCHAR(50)
  );

  CREATE TABLE Courses (
      CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      CourseName VARCHAR(50)
  );

  CREATE TABLE CourseEnrollments (
      StudentID INT,
      CourseID INT,
      EnrollmentDate DATE,
      PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),
      FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
      FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
  );
  ```

## Summary

- **Primary Key**:
  - Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
  - Cannot be NULL.
  - Can be a single column or a composite key.

- **Foreign Key**:
  - Establishes relationships between tables.
  - Enforces referential integrity.
  - Can contain NULL values unless defined otherwise.
  - Supports cascading actions like `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

Primary and foreign keys are essential for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables in a relational database. They enable complex queries and ensure that the data remains consistent and accurate.
