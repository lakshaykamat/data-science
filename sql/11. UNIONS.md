### UNION in SQL

The `UNION` operator in SQL is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. It removes duplicate records between the result sets, unless `UNION ALL` is used, which includes duplicates. The `UNION` operator is particularly useful when you need to retrieve data from multiple tables or multiple queries and present it as a single set of results.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

- **UNION ALL**: This variant of the `UNION` operator does not remove duplicate rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table2;
  ```

#### Rules for Using UNION

1. **Number of Columns**: The number of columns in the `SELECT` statements must be the same.
2. **Data Types**: The data types of the corresponding columns must be compatible.
3. **Order of Columns**: The columns must be in the same order in all `SELECT` statements.

#### Example

Suppose we have two tables: `Employees` and `Contractors`.

- **Employees**:

  | EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |
  |------------|-----------|----------|------------|
  | 1          | John      | Doe      | Sales      |
  | 2          | Jane      | Smith    | HR         |

- **Contractors**:
  | ContractorID | FirstName | LastName | Department |
  |--------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|
  | 101             | Jim          | Brown    | Marketing            |
  | 102             | Jack         | White     | IT                         |

To retrieve a combined list of all people (both employees and contractors) with their names and departments:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Contractors;
```

- **Result**:

  | FirstName | LastName | Department |
  |-----------|----------|------------|
  | John      | Doe      | Sales      |
  | Jane      | Smith    | HR         |
  | Jim       | Brown    | Marketing  |
  | Jack      | White    | IT         |

If you want to include duplicates, you can use `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Contractors;
```

### Summary

- **UNION**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements and removes duplicates.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM table1 UNION SELECT ... FROM table2;`
- **UNION ALL**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements and includes duplicates.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT ... FROM table2;`
- **Rules**:
  - Same number of columns in each `SELECT` statement.
  - Compatible data types for corresponding columns.
  - Same order of columns in each `SELECT` statement.

The `UNION` operator is a powerful tool for merging datasets from different tables or queries, enabling you to create comprehensive result sets that include data from multiple sources.
