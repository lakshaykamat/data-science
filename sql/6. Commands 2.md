# UPDATE and DELETE Commands in SQL

The `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands are part of the Data Manipulation Language (DML) in SQL. They are used to modify and remove data in database tables, respectively.

## 1. UPDATE Command
The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns for selected rows.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE table_name
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE Employees
  SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
  WHERE DepartmentID = 5;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - `UPDATE Employees`: Specifies the table to update.
  - `SET Salary = Salary * 1.1`: Sets the new value for the `Salary` column.
  - `WHERE DepartmentID = 5`: Specifies the condition to filter which rows to update.

## 2. DELETE Command
The `DELETE` command is used to remove existing records from a table. It deletes rows based on a specified condition.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Employees
  WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - `DELETE FROM Employees`: Specifies the table from which to delete records.
  - `WHERE LastName = 'Smith'`: Specifies the condition to filter which rows to delete.

# Important Considerations

1. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Always use the `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to update or delete. Without it, the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` command will affect all rows in the table.

2. **Subqueries**:
   - You can use subqueries in the `WHERE` clause to perform more complex updates or deletions.
   ```sql
   UPDATE Employees
   SET DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales')
   WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
   ```

3. **JOINs**:
   - You can join tables in the `UPDATE` command to update records based on related tables.
   ```sql
   UPDATE Employees
   SET Employees.Salary = Employees.Salary * 1.1
   FROM Employees
   JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID
   WHERE Departments.DepartmentName = 'Sales';
   ```

4. **Transactions**:
   - For critical updates or deletions, consider using transactions to ensure data integrity. Transactions allow you to commit or roll back changes if something goes wrong.
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;

   UPDATE Employees
   SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
   WHERE DepartmentID = 5;

   DELETE FROM Employees
   WHERE LastName = 'Smith';

   COMMIT;
   ```

### Summary

- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.
  - Syntax: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;`
  - Example: `UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE DepartmentID = 5;`

- **DELETE**: Removes existing records from a table.
  - Syntax: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
  - Example: `DELETE FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Smith';`

Using `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands efficiently and carefully ensures accurate data modification and deletion in a database.
