# SQL Clauses and Operators: SELECT, WHERE, OPERATORS, LIMIT, ORDER BY

## 1. SELECT Clause
The `SELECT` clause is used to fetch data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, sometimes called the result set.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
  ```

## 2. WHERE Clause
The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
  ```

## 3. Operators in SQL
Operators are used to specify conditions in SQL statements. They are broadly categorized into:

### Comparison Operators:
  - `=`: Equal to
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age = 30;
    ```
  - `<>` or `!=`: Not equal to
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age <> 30;
    ```
  - `>`: Greater than
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30;
    ```
  - `<`: Less than
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age < 30;
    ```
  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age >= 30;
    ```
  - `<=`: Less than or equal to
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age <= 30;
    ```

### Logical Operators:
  - `AND`: Combines two or more conditions, all must be true.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 25 AND Salary > 50000;
    ```
  - `OR`: Combines two or more conditions, at least one must be true.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age < 25 OR Salary > 50000;
    ```
  - `NOT`: Negates a condition.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE NOT Age = 30;
    ```

### Arithmetic Operators:
  - `+`: Addition
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary + 5000 AS NewSalary FROM Employees;
    ```
  - `-`: Subtraction
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary - 5000 AS NewSalary FROM Employees;
    ```
  - `*`: Multiplication
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary * 1.1 AS NewSalary FROM Employees;
    ```
  - `/`: Division
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary / 2 AS HalfSalary FROM Employees;
    ```

### Other Operators:
  - `BETWEEN`: Selects values within a given range.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age BETWEEN 25 AND 30;
    ```
  - `LIKE`: Searches for a specified pattern in a column.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';
    ```
  - `IN`: Specifies multiple possible values for a column.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName IN ('Smith', 'Johnson');
    ```

## 4. LIMIT Clause
The `LIMIT` clause is used to specify the number of records to return. It is useful for pagination.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  LIMIT number;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees LIMIT 5;
  ```

- **Pagination Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
  ```
  This returns 10 records starting from the 21st record.

## 5. ORDER BY Clause
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set in either ascending or descending order.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;
  ```

- **Multiple Columns Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC, FirstName DESC;
  ```

### Example Combining All Clauses

Hereâ€™s an example that combines `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT`, and `ORDER BY` clauses along with operators:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Age >= 30 AND Salary > 40000
ORDER BY Age DESC, Salary ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Summary

- **SELECT**: Fetches data from the database.
- **WHERE**: Filters records based on specified conditions.
- **Operators**: Used in conditions to filter data (Comparison, Logical, Arithmetic, and Other Operators).
- **LIMIT**: Limits the number of records returned.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.

Understanding these SQL clauses and operators allows for efficient querying, filtering, sorting, and limiting of data in relational databases.
