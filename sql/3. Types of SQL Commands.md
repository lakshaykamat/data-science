# Types of SQL Commands

SQL commands are classified into several categories based on their functionality. Here are the main types:

## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
- **Purpose**: Define, alter, and manage database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas.
- **Commands**:
  - `CREATE`: Creates a new table, database, index, or view.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50),
        LastName VARCHAR(50)
    );
    ```
  - `ALTER`: Modifies an existing database object like a table.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN BirthDate DATE;
    ```
  - `DROP`: Deletes an existing database object.
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE Employees;
    ```
  - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
    ```

## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- **Purpose**: Retrieve, insert, update, and delete data in a database.
- **Commands**:
  - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees;
    ```
  - `INSERT`: Adds new rows of data to a table.
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('John', 'Doe');
    ```
  - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data in a table.
    ```sql
    UPDATE Employees SET LastName = 'Smith' WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    ```
  - `DELETE`: Removes existing data from a table.
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    ```

## 3. Data Control Language (DCL)
- **Purpose**: Control access to data in the database.
- **Commands**:
  - `GRANT`: Gives a user access privileges to the database.
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO 'user1';
    ```
  - `REVOKE`: Removes access privileges from a user.
    ```sql
    REVOKE INSERT ON Employees FROM 'user1';
    ```

## 4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
- **Purpose**: Manage transactions in a database to ensure data integrity.
- **Commands**:
  - `COMMIT`: Saves all transactions to the database.
    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```
  - `ROLLBACK`: Reverts the database to the last committed state.
    ```sql
    ROLLBACK;
    ```
  - `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a point within a transaction to which a rollback can be performed.
    ```sql
    SAVEPOINT sp 1;
    ```
  - `RELEASE SAVEPOINT`: Removes a savepoint within a transaction.
    ```sql
    RELEASE SAVEPOINT sp 1;
    ```

## 5. Data Query Language (DQL)
- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from the database.
- **Commands**:
  - `SELECT`: The primary command for querying data.
    ```sql
    SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
    ```

# Summary

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Commands to define and manage database structures.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Commands to manipulate data within database objects.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Commands to control access to data.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: Commands to manage transactions and ensure data integrity.
- **DQL (Data Query Language)**: Primarily the `SELECT` command for querying data.

Understanding these SQL command types helps in effectively managing and manipulating data within a relational database.
