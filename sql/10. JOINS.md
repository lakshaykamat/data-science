### JOINS in SQL

Joins are used in SQL to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins, each serving a different purpose. The most commonly used joins are INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

#### 1. **INNER JOIN**
An INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  INNER JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  INNER JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query returns only the employees who have a matching department in the Departments table.

#### 2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (table 1), and the matched rows from the right table (table 2). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  LEFT JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query returns all employees, and if an employee is not assigned to any department, the DepartmentName will be NULL.

#### 3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
A RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table (table 2), and the matched rows from the left table (table 1). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  RIGHT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  RIGHT JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query returns all departments, and if a department does not have any employees, the employee details will be NULL.

#### 4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**
A FULL JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in either table. It returns NULL for unmatched rows on either side.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  FULL JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  FULL JOIN Departments
  ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query returns all employees and all departments. If there are employees without departments or departments without employees, the missing values will be NULL.

#### 5. **CROSS JOIN**
A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of the two tables. It combines each row of the first table with each row of the second table.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  CROSS JOIN table2;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  CROSS JOIN Departments;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query returns every possible combination of employees and departments.

#### 6. **SELF JOIN**
A SELF JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT a.column1, b.column2
  FROM table_name a, table_name b
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT a.EmployeeID AS Employee, b.EmployeeID AS Manager
  FROM Employees a, Employees b
  WHERE a.ManagerID = b.EmployeeID;
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - This query returns a list of employees and their managers by joining the Employees table with itself.

### Summary

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM Employees INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;`

- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, with matched rows from the right table or NULL.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;`

- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table, with matched rows from the left table or NULL.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM Employees RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;`

- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table, with unmatched rows from both sides being NULL.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM Employees FULL JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;`

- **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of two tables.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM Employees CROSS JOIN Departments;`

- **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself to create a result set that combines rows from the same table.
  - Example: `SELECT a.EmployeeID AS Employee, b.EmployeeID AS Manager FROM Employees a, Employees b WHERE a.ManagerID = b.EmployeeID;`

Understanding joins is fundamental for querying relational databases effectively, allowing you to retrieve and manipulate data across multiple tables.
