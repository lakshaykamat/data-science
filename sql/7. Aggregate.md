# Aggregate Functions in SQL

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. They are commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause and can perform operations like summing, counting, averaging, finding minimum or maximum values, and more.

## 1. **COUNT()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  COUNT(column_name)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID) AS NumberOfEmployees FROM Employees;
  ```

## 2. **SUM ()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SUM(column_name)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaries FROM Employees;
  ```

## 3. **AVG ()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  AVG(column_name)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;
  ```

## 4. **MIN ()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the smallest value in a column.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  MIN(column_name)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary FROM Employees;
  ```

## 5. **MAX ()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the largest value in a column.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  MAX(column_name)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary FROM Employees;
  ```

## 6. **GROUP BY Clause**
- **Purpose**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "find the number of employees in each department."
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name;
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS NumberOfEmployees
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY DepartmentID;
  ```

## 7. **HAVING Clause**
- **Purpose**: Used to filter groups based on a condition. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but is used with aggregate functions.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name
  HAVING condition;
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY DepartmentID
  HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
  ```

## Combining Aggregate Functions and Clauses

Hereâ€™s an example that combines `SELECT`, aggregate functions, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS NumberOfEmployees, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(EmployeeID) > 10;
```

## Summary

- **COUNT ()**: Counts the number of rows.
- **SUM ()**: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
- **AVG ()**: Finds the average of a numeric column.
- **MIN ()**: Identifies the minimum value.
- **MAX ()**: Identifies the maximum value.
- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows sharing a property so aggregate functions can be applied to each group.
- **HAVING**: Filters groups based on a specified condition.

Aggregate functions are essential for summarizing and analyzing data in SQL, allowing for powerful data manipulation and insights.
