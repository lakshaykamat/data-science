### SQL Views

A **view** in SQL is a virtual table that is defined by a query. Unlike a real table, a view does not store data physically. Instead, it provides a way to simplify complex queries, encapsulate data access, and enhance security by restricting access to specific data within the underlying tables.

#### Key Features of Views

- **Virtual Table**: A view behaves like a table but does not store data itself.
- **Simplify Queries**: Views can encapsulate complex joins, calculations, and data transformations.
- **Access Control**: Views can limit user access to specific columns or rows in underlying tables.
- **Data Abstraction**: Views provide an abstraction layer, allowing users to interact with data without needing to know the details of the underlying schema.

#### Creating a View

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW SalesSummary AS
  SELECT ProductID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
  FROM Sales
  GROUP BY ProductID;
  ```

  - **Explanation**:
    - This view, `SalesSummary`, provides a summary of total sales per product by aggregating sales amounts.

#### Querying a View

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM view_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT ProductID, TotalSales
  FROM SalesSummary
  WHERE TotalSales > 10000;
  ```

  - **Explanation**:
    - This query retrieves products from the `SalesSummary` view where the total sales exceed 10,000.

#### Modifying a View

- **Updating a View**:
  - If the view is updatable (i.e., based on a single table without complex joins or aggregations), you can perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.

  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE SalesSummary
    SET TotalSales = 15000
    WHERE ProductID = 101;
    ```

- **Dropping a View**:
  - To remove a view, use the `DROP VIEW` command.

  - **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW view_name;
    ```

  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW SalesSummary;
    ```

- **Altering a View**:
  - To modify the definition of an existing view, use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` command.

  - **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW SalesSummary AS
    SELECT ProductID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales, COUNT(*) AS SalesCount
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY ProductID;
    ```

#### Types of Views

1. **Simple Views**: Based on a single table with no aggregate functions or joins. They can be used to restrict access to certain columns or rows.

2. **Complex Views**: Involve multiple tables, joins, and/or aggregate functions. They are useful for encapsulating complex queries and providing a simplified interface for users.

3. **Materialized Views**: Unlike regular views, materialized views store the result set physically. This can improve performance for complex queries, but they need to be refreshed periodically to reflect changes in the underlying data.

#### Summary

- **Creating a View**: Defines a virtual table with a `CREATE VIEW` statement.
  - Example: `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition;`

- **Querying a View**: Retrieve data from a view using a `SELECT` statement.
  - Example: `SELECT ... FROM view_name WHERE condition;`

- **Modifying a View**:
  - **Update**: Modify data through the view if it's updatable.
  - **Drop**: Remove the view with `DROP VIEW view_name;`
  - **Alter**: Change the view definition with `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition;`

- **Types of Views**:
  - **Simple Views**: Single table, no aggregates or joins.
  - **Complex Views**: Multiple tables, joins, aggregates.
  - **Materialized Views**: Physically stored results, improved performance but requires refresh.

Views are a powerful feature in SQL that help manage and simplify data access, enhance security, and provide an abstraction layer over complex queries.
